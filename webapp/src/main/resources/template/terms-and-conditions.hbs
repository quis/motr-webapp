    <div class="text">
        <p>This page and any pages it links to explains MOT reminders' terms of
            use. You must agree to these to use MOT reminders.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Who we are</h2>
        <p>MOT reminders is managed by Driver and Vehicle and Standards Agency
            (DVSA). DVSA will be referred to as "we" from now on.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Using MOT reminders</h2>
        <p>You agree to use MOT reminders only for lawful purposes. You must
            also use it in a way that doesn't infringe the rights of, or restrict or inhibit
            the use and enjoyment of, this site by anyone else.</p>

        <p>We update MOT reminders all the time. We can change or remove
            content at any time without notice.</p>

        <p>This MOT reminder service is provided on a voluntary basis to remind
            vehicle owners of the MOT due date. It remains your responsibility to
            ensure that the vehicle you are driving is in a roadworthy condition. We
            cannot be held responsible if you do not receive an email reminding you
            of the vehicles due date.</p>

        <p>When signing up to MOT reminders you must only provide an email
            address you have ownership for or permission to use.</p>

        <p>You are only entitled to sign up for MOT reminders for vehicles you have
            a vested interest in.</p>

        <p>If you change the registration number of the vehicle you have signed up
            for an MOT reminder, the MOT reminder service will update the
            subscription to the new registration number. This may take a few days
            from when DVLA confirms they have processed the registration number
            transfer. If you transfer your personalised registration number to a new
            vehicle, you should unsubscribe and sign up for a MOT reminder for the
            new vehicle.</p>

        <p>Where we identify that an email address provided does not exist
            anymore, we will automatically delete the subscription.</p>

        <p>We're not liable for any loss or damage that may come from using MOT
            reminders. This includes:</p>

            do this in certain cases, eg if it breaches copyright laws, contains
            sensitive personal data or material that may be considered obscene or

        <p>Any dispute you have which relates to these terms and conditions, or
            your use of MOT reminders (whether it be contractual or
            non-contractual), will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
            of England and Wales.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">General</h2>

            or illegal for any reason, the remaining terms and conditions will still
